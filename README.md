# Lucene

The Implementation incorporates the developing a search engine to index and search an aggregated collection of news articles and evaluate the results based on a query result using Apache Lucene. Each document within the collection is distinguished by a DOC tag which is then recognized, parsed and indexed. Parsing is done based on different fields and then aggregation of analysers are utilised. A list of topics was utilized for query generation and the outcomes were assessed utilizing Retrieval models. Mean average precision is considered as a metric for the evaluation.
